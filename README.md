## 1) Project background

This analysis is based on real world but anonymized data, with fresh collected business data.

This project focuses on analyzing a diverse set of data related to the hotel and accommodation industry, including marketing performance, website traffic, visitor behavior, booking engine usage, reservation patterns, and occupancy trends. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights and formulate data-driven recommendations that help optimize and maximize accommodation bookings.

By leveraging this comprehensive dataset, the analysis explores ways to:

- Improve the efficiency of marketing campaigns and maximize ROI.
- Enhance website usability and booking engine performance to boost user engagement.
- Identify key patterns and trends in booking behavior to target high-value opportunities.
- Optimize occupancy rates by understanding changes in demand and availability.
- The findings aim to provide a strategic foundation for improving the overall performance of hotel booking systems and achieving greater profitability in the competitive accommodation market.

The analysis was originally made for the in-house competition of the [Data36.com](https://data36.com) data science club, where I ranked at second place with this work.

## 2) Project Objective and Results

### *Objective*
